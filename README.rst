FEDOT Timeseries benchmarking  [OBSOLETE, see `pytsbe <https://github.com/ITMO-NSS-team/pytsbe>`__ for actual examples]
============

The repository contains some experiments and benchmarks of our AutoML framework
(FEDOT) on timeseries forecasting tasks.
We are planning to compare state-of-the-art AutoML frameworks in this task and
design the suitable strategies for automatic data-driven model identification
that will be integrated into Fedot.

This is an ongoing research.


Current progress
============
The proof-of-concept of AutoML for timeseries forecasting was already implemented
in FEDOT and some promising results were obtained.
For instance, check our paper `"Automated Data-Driven Approach for Gap Filling in the Time Series Using Evolutionary Learning" <https://www.researchgate.net/publication/354789225_Automated_Data-Driven_Approach_for_Gap_Filling_in_the_Time_Series_Using_Evolutionary_Learning>`__
about timeseries gap filling with FEDOT.
