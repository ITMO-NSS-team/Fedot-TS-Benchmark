FEDOT Timeseries benchmarking
============

The repository contains some experiments and benchmarks of our AutoML framework
(FEDOT) on timeseries forecasting tasks.
We are planning to compare state-of-the-art AutoML frameworks in this task and
design the suitable strategies for automatic data-driven model identification
that will be integrated into Fedot.

This is an ongoing research.

Current progress
============
The proof-of-concept of AutoML for timeseries forecasting was already implemented
in FEDOT and some promising results were obtained.
For instance, check `our fresh paper <https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.01124>`__
about timeseries gap filling with FEDOT.
